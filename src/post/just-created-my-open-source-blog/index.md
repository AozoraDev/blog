Yahoo!
And welcome to my humble blog!
I'm Aozora and this is my first post on my open source blog.

Uhm... What should I write on this blog now? Maybe about my projects? Food? How to make **meth**ylphenidate? Pleasurable sex styles? Or how to pay taxes? \
Welp, I'll write ANYTHING I like on this blog and you can't stop me. XD

Okay so uhm... This blog is created using [11ty](https://www.11ty.dev/) and [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/). 11ty handles all aspects of this blog, while Bootstrap serves as the website's UI because I'm the type of person who is lazy to write CSS from scratch.

The reason I created this blog is because I was inspired by [Nicky Case](https://ncase.me/) while reading their [blog](https://blog.ncase.me/). Their open-source blog concept, without comment sections, without reactions, just posts and freedom, motivated me to create a blog similar to Nicky's. \
So I started looking at their source code and began working on my own blog. It really took me a week to create this simple blog because I've been quite lazy lately lol.

This blog is still very simple, but I'll update it as often as possible (if I'm not feeling lazy). Perhaps add RSS or other features... I don't know, maybe you can help me with that. This blog is open source and is under the MIT license.

Seeyounara~
